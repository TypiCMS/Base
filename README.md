### URLs

The CMS manages the following URL patterns:

**Modules:**

- /en/events/slug-in-english
- /fr/evenements/slug-en-francais

**Pages:**

- /en/parent-page-slug/subpage-slug/page-slug
- /fr/slug-parent/slug-sous-page/slug-page

## Requirements

- PHP 8.4+
- One of the database engines supported by Laravel (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, SQL Server)

For all server requirements, see the [Laravel deployment documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/master/deployment#server-requirements).

## Installation

Install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) first, then:

1. Create a new project:

    ```
    composer create-project typicms/base mywebsite
    ```

2. Enter the project folder:

    ```
    cd mywebsite
    ```

3. Run the installer, which handles database migration and seeding, creates an admin user, installs npm packages, and sets directory permissions:

    ```
    php artisan typicms:install
    ```

Go to http://mywebsite.test/admin and log in.

### Assets

Assets are bundled with [Vite](https://laravel.com/docs/master/vite). Install [Bun](https://bun.sh), then run:

1. Install npm packages:

    ```
    bun install
    ```

2. Start the development server:

    ```
    bun run dev
    ```

3. Build for production:

    ```
    bun run prod
    ```

### Locales configuration

1. Set the locales in `config/typicms.php`. The first key of this array is the main locale and must match the locale defined in `config/app.php`.
2. Set `main_locale_in_url` in `config/typicms.php` to `true` or `false` depending on whether you want the main locale to appear in the URL.

### Installation of a module

The following example installs the News module. After these steps, the module will appear in the admin sidebar.

1. Install the module with Composer:

    ```
    composer require typicms/news
    ```

2. Add `TypiCMS\Modules\News\Providers\ModuleServiceProvider::class,` to `bootstrap/providers.php`, in the _TypiCMS Modules Service Providers_ section.

3. Publish the views and migrations:

    ```
    php artisan vendor:publish
    ```

4. Run the database migration:

    ```
    php artisan migrate
    ```

### Module scaffolding

To generate a new custom module called Cats:

1. Create the module:

    ```
    php artisan typicms:create cats
    ```

2. The module is created in `/Modules/Cats`. Customize it as needed.
3. Add `TypiCMS\Modules\Cats\Providers\ModuleServiceProvider::class,` to `bootstrap/providers.php`, in the _TypiCMS Modules Service Providers_ section.
4. Run the migration:

    ```
    php artisan migrate
    ```

## Available modules

Each module can be [published](#publish-a-module) to be tracked by git and customized locally.

### Pages

Pages are nestable with drag and drop. On a drop, URIs are regenerated and saved in the database. Each translation of a page has its own route. A page can be linked to a module and can have multiple sections, each using its own template.

The admin panel includes a searchable pages tree with keyboard-accessible expand/collapse controls.

### Menus

Each menu has nestable entries. An entry can link to a page or a URL, and can optionally link to a specific section of a page.

Render an HTML menu in a Blade file with `@menu('menuname')`.

### Projects

Projects have categories. Project URLs follow this pattern: `/en/projects/category-slug/project-slug`.

### Tags

Tags support polymorphic many-to-many relations, so they can be linked to any module. The tag input uses [Tom Select](https://tom-select.js.org).

### Events

Events have starting and ending dates.

### News

News module.

### Contacts

Frontend contact form with admin-side records management. Notifications are sent to the visitor and the webmaster.

### Partners

A partner has a logo, website URL, title, and body content.

### Files

The file manager lets you upload and organize images, documents, and folders. File uploads use [Uppy](https://uppy.io) with drag-and-drop support and a compression step before upload. Images can be cropped using [Cropper.js](https://fengyuanchen.github.io/cropperjs/). SVG files are sanitized on upload. Images can be swapped in place from the file manager.

To store original images on a remote service such as Amazon S3 while serving cropped images from local disk, set `FILESYSTEM_DRIVER=s3` in your `.env` file and configure `croppa.php` accordingly.

### Users and roles

Admins can authenticate with a passkey or a one-time password in addition to a standard password. User registration can be enabled in the settings panel (`/admin/settings`). Roles and permissions are managed with [spatie/laravel-permission](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-permission). Admins can impersonate users.

### Blocks

Blocks let you display custom content in your views.

Render a block in Blade with `Blocks::render('blockname')` or `@block('blockname')`.

### Translations

Translations can be managed in the database via the admin panel (`/admin/translations`).

Retrieve a translation using the standard Laravel helpers: `__('Key')`, `trans('Key')`, or `@lang('Key')`.

### Sitemap

A sitemap is generated automatically from all published pages. It is available at `/sitemap.xml`.

### Settings

Manage the website title, logo, and other global options in the settings panel.

### History

Create, update, delete, online, and offline events are logged in the database. The most recent records are shown on the back-office dashboard.

## Artisan commands

### Install TypiCMS

```
php artisan typicms:install
```

### Run the initial migration and seed

```
php artisan typicms:database
```

This command is called automatically by `typicms:install`.

### Create a superuser

```
php artisan typicms:user
```

### Publish a module

To customize a module — for example, to add fields or a relation — publish it:

```
php artisan typicms:publish <modulename>
```

This will:

1. Publish the module's views and migrations.
2. Copy the module source to `/Modules/<Modulename>`.
3. Remove the Composer package with `composer remove typicms/<modulename>`.

Once published, the module lives in `/Modules/<Modulename>` and is tracked by git, so changes are preserved across `composer update` runs.
