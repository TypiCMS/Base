## Installation

First install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org)

1. Create a new project

    ```
    composer create-project typicms/base mywebsite
    ```

2. Enter the newly created folder

    ```
    cd mywebsite
    ```

3. Migration of the database, seeding, user creation, npm packages installation and directory permissions.

    ```
    php artisan typicms:install
    ```

Note: if you use MariaDB, set 'mariadb' to true in config/typicms.php

Go to http://mywebsite.test/admin and log in.

### Assets

Assets are bundled with [Vite](https://laravel.com/docs/master/vite).
In order to work on assets, you can install [Bun](https://bun.com), then go to your website folder and run these commands:

1. Install npm packages (in directory **node_modules**)

    ```
    bun install
    ```

2. Compile admin and public assets

    ```
    bun run dev
    ```

### Locales configuration

1. Set the locales in config/typicms.php, the first key of this array is the main locale and should be the same as the locale defined in config/app.php.
2. Set main_locale_in_url in config/typicms.php to true or false.

### Installation of a module

This example is for the News module. After these steps, the module will appear in the sidebar of the back office.
If you need to customize it, you can [publish it](#publish-a-module)!

1. Install a module with Composer

    ```
    composer require typicms/news
    ```

2. Add `TypiCMS\Modules\News\Providers\ModuleServiceProvider::class,` to **config/app.php**, before `TypiCMS\Modules\Core\Providers\ModuleServiceProvider::class,`
3. Publish the views and migrations

    ```
    php artisan vendor:publish
    ```

4. Migrate the database

    ```
    php artisan migrate
    ```

### Module scaffolding

Let’s create a module called Cats.

1. Create the module with artisan:

    ```
    php artisan typicms:create cats
    ```

2. The module is in **/Modules/Cats**, you can customize it
3. Add `TypiCMS\Modules\Cats\Providers\ModuleServiceProvider::class,` to **config/app.php**, before `TypiCMS\Modules\Core\Providers\ModuleServiceProvider::class,`
4. Migrate the database

    ```
    php artisan migrate
    ```

## Available modules

Each module can be [published](#publish-a-module).

### Pages

Pages are nestable with a drag and drop, on drop, URIs are generated and saved in the database.
Each translation of a page has its own route.
A page can be linked to a module.
A page can have multiple sections.

### Menus

Each menu has nestable entries. One entry can be linked to a page or URL.
You can return a HTML formated menu with `Menus::render('menuname')` or `@menu('menuname')`.

### Projects

Projects have categories, projects URLs follows this pattern: /en/projects/category-slug/project-slug

### Tags

Tags are linked to projects and use the [Selectize](https://brianreavis.github.io/selectize.js/) plugin.
The tags module has many to many polymorphic relations so a tag can be easily linked to any module.

### Events

Events have starting and ending dates.

### News

News module.

### Contacts

Frontend contact form and admin side records management.

### Partners

A partner has a logo, website URL, title and body content.

### Files

The files module allows you to upload and organize images, documents and folders. It works with [DropzoneJS](http://www.dropzonejs.com) for the uploading proccess.
Thumbnails are generated on the fly thanks to [Croppa](https://github.com/BKWLD/croppa).

If you want to store the original images on a storage service such as Amazon s3 and your cropped images on the local disk, set `FILESYSTEM_DRIVER=s3` in your **.env** file and in **config/croppa.php** set `'src_dir' => 'filesystem.default.driver'` and `'crops_dir' => storage_path('app/public')`.

### Users and roles

User registration can be enabled through the settings panel (/admin/settings).
Roles and Permissions are managed with [spatie/laravel-permission](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-permission).

### Blocks

Blocks are useful to display custom content in your views.
You can display the content of a block with `Blocks::render('blockname')` or `@block('blockname')`.

### Translations

Translations can be stored in the database through the admin panel (/admin/translations).

You can get a translation from the database with the standard Laravel functions: `__('Key')`, `trans('Key')` or `@lang('Key')`.

### Sitemap

A sitemap is generated by reading all pages available in your project. The URL is /sitemap.xml.

### Settings

Change the website title, logo, and other options in the settings panel.

### History

_created_, _updated_, _deleted_, _online_ and _offline_ actions are logged in database.
Latest records are displayed in the back office’s dashboard.

## Facades

Each module has a [facade](https://laravel.com/docs/master/facades#main-content) that gives you access to the model, you can call for example `News::latest(3)` to get the three latest news.
Check available methods in each module’s models.

## Artisan commands

Commands are located in **/vendor/typicms/core/src/Commands**

### Installation of TypiCMS

```
php artisan typicms:install
```

### Initial migration and seed

```
php artisan typicms:database
```

This command is triggered by `typicms:install`

### Publish a module

If you want to modify a module, for example to add some fields or a relation, you have to publish it by running:

```
php artisan typicms:publish <modulename>
```

The module is now located in the **/Modules** directory.

These steps will be executed:

1. Publishing of views and migrations for Pages module.
2. Copying of everything excepted views and migrations from **/vendor/typicms/pages/src** to **/Modules/Pages**.
3. Running `composer remove typicms/pages`.

When a module is published, it will be tracked by git and you will be able to make changes in **/Modules/Modulename** directory without loosing changes when running `composer update`.
